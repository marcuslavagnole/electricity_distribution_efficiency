This repository provides the R routines from the article [Estimating the Efficiency of Brazilian Electricity Distribution Utilities](https://doi.org/10.1080/02664763.2021.1890000). It is a joint work with Ralph S. Silva, Mario Jorge Mendon√ßa, and Amaro Olimpio Pereira Jr., published in the _Journal of Applied Statistics_.

The paper proposes an alternative methodology from the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency on the efficiency estimation for the Brazilian electricity distribution sector. Our proposal combines robust state-space models and stochastic frontier analysis to measure the operational cost efficiency in a panel data set from 60 Brazilian electricity distribution utilities. The modeling joins the main literature in energy economics with advanced econometric and statistical techniques to estimate the efficiencies. Moreover, the suggested model can deal with changes in the inefficiencies across time, whilst the Bayesian paradigm, through Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, facilitates the inference on all unknowns. The method enables significant flexibility in the resultant efficiencies and a complete photography of the distribution sector.
